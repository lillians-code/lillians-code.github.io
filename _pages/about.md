I am a Senior Data Scientist and this is where I show off all my cool projects!


## What else do you do?

Outside of my data science pursuits, I read books, run, and spend time with my dogs. I have two amazing, fluffy good boys, Bart and Blue, and one of my favourite things to do is to spend time with them at the park or cuddling at home.
